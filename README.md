# CS210-Programming-Languages

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
> The app was made for a pseudo-company that required software to track and display data about the purchases made daily at a grocery store.

### What did you do particularly well?
> I think that the input verification code was done well. I like its modularity, conciseness, and straight-forwardness.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
> My code could be improved by better handling the file reading in the python code. Rereading and rebuilding the data structure every time would get slow very quickly if the sample size were bigger.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
> The most challenging part of this code was the input verification. I did a bit of research and then worked out a solution. Stack-Overflow and W3 Schools were particularly helpful resources.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
> There are many skills that I learned in this course that would be transferable to other projects, but the ability to integrate separate languages into one app was a particularly useful skill this course taught me. I had no experience with coding in more than one language for one project before this point, so this is the area in which I improved the most.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
> The program is well organized, the comments are well documented, and the code is modular.
